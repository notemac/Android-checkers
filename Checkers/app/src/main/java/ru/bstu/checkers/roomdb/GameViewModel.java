/**
 * The ViewModel's role is to provide data to the UI and survive configuration changes.
 * A ViewModel acts as a communication center between the Repository and the UI.
 * You can also use a ViewModel to share data between fragments. The ViewModel is part of the lifecycle library.
 * A ViewModel holds your app's UI data in a lifecycle-conscious way that survives configuration changes.
 * Separating your app's UI data from your Activity and Fragment classes lets you better follow the single
 * responsibility principle: Your activities and fragments are responsible for drawing data to the screen,
 * while your ViewModel can take care of holding and processing all the data needed for the UI.
 * In the ViewModel, use LiveData for changeable data that the UI will use or display.
 * Using LiveData has several benefits:
 *     You can put an observer on the data (instead of polling for changes) and only update the
 *     the UI when the data actually changes.
 *     The Repository and the UI are completely separated by the ViewModel.
 *There are no database calls from the ViewModel, making the code more testable.
